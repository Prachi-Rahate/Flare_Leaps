Not yet converged! Some chains are less than 30x the autocorrelation length. Please continue to run with longer chains, or start again with more walkers.

Performing diagnostic tests on the fit's residuals...

Anderson-Darling Test
---------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals follows a normal distribution.
Test statistic		 0.1812041807672813
Critical values		 [0.572 0.652 0.782 0.912 1.085]
Significance levels	 [0.15  0.1   0.05  0.025 0.01 ]
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
... 0.15 		 True
... 0.1 		 True
... 0.05 		 True
... 0.025 		 True
... 0.01 		 True
The null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
In simple words: your residuals look good.


Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
----------------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals show non-stationarity (trends).
Test Statistic           -4.827773
P-Value                   0.000048
# Lags Used               8.000000
# Observations Used     589.000000
Critical Value (1%)      -3.441501
Critical Value (5%)      -2.866460
Critical Value (10%)     -2.569390
Is the time series stationary? True
In simple words: your residuals look good.


Durbin-Watson Test
------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Test statistic: 1.3934727395069169
The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Interpretation:
	< 1.5 suggests a positive correlation
	1.5 to 2.5 suggests no correlation
	> 2.5 suggests a negative correlation
Signs of a positive correlation.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Ljung-Box Test
--------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
 lag    lb_stat    lb_pvalue  0.15   0.1  0.05  0.025  0.01
   1  54.808289 1.328791e-13 False False False  False False
   5 261.523507 1.849053e-54 False False False  False False
  10 414.778182 6.720650e-83 False False False  False False
  15 465.107562 1.335680e-89 False False False  False False
  20 497.727363 8.703555e-93 False False False  False False
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.
