Performing diagnostic tests on the fit's residuals...

Anderson-Darling Test
---------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals follows a normal distribution.
Test statistic		 19.078779826332095
Critical values		 [0.561 0.639 0.766 0.894 1.063]
Significance levels	 [0.15  0.1   0.05  0.025 0.01 ]
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
... 0.15 		 False
... 0.1 		 False
... 0.05 		 False
... 0.025 		 False
... 0.01 		 False
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
----------------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals show non-stationarity (trends).
Test Statistic         -5.865618e+00
P-Value                 3.331019e-07
# Lags Used             2.000000e+00
# Observations Used     1.390000e+02
Critical Value (1%)    -3.478294e+00
Critical Value (5%)    -2.882568e+00
Critical Value (10%)   -2.577983e+00
Is the time series stationary? True
In simple words: your residuals look good.


Durbin-Watson Test
------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Test statistic: 0.8826507479023716
The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Interpretation:
	< 1.5 suggests a positive correlation
	1.5 to 2.5 suggests no correlation
	> 2.5 suggests a negative correlation
Signs of a positive correlation.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Ljung-Box Test
--------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
 lag   lb_stat    lb_pvalue  0.15   0.1  0.05  0.025  0.01
   1 45.233465 1.748910e-11 False False False  False False
   5 58.980898 1.973529e-11 False False False  False False
  10 64.908263 4.220413e-10 False False False  False False
  15 72.658578 1.494885e-09 False False False  False False
  20 81.387270 2.279873e-09 False False False  False False
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.
