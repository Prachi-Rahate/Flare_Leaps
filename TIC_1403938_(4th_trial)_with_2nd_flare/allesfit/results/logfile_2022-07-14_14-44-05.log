Performing diagnostic tests on the fit's residuals...

Anderson-Darling Test
---------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals follows a normal distribution.
Test statistic		 7.610754687387953
Critical values		 [0.561 0.639 0.766 0.894 1.063]
Significance levels	 [0.15  0.1   0.05  0.025 0.01 ]
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
... 0.15 		 False
... 0.1 		 False
... 0.05 		 False
... 0.025 		 False
... 0.01 		 False
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
----------------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals show non-stationarity (trends).
Test Statistic         -6.668929e+00
P-Value                 4.640764e-09
# Lags Used             3.000000e+00
# Observations Used     1.380000e+02
Critical Value (1%)    -3.478648e+00
Critical Value (5%)    -2.882722e+00
Critical Value (10%)   -2.578065e+00
Is the time series stationary? True
In simple words: your residuals look good.


Durbin-Watson Test
------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Test statistic: 2.1668996262150393
The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Interpretation:
	< 1.5 suggests a positive correlation
	1.5 to 2.5 suggests no correlation
	> 2.5 suggests a negative correlation
No signs of a correlation.
In simple words: your residuals look good.


Ljung-Box Test
--------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
 lag   lb_stat  lb_pvalue  0.15   0.1  0.05  0.025  0.01
   1  1.012118   0.314396  True  True  True   True  True
   5 14.990264   0.010404 False False False  False  True
  10 26.635080   0.002974 False False False  False False
  15 29.024638   0.015968 False False False  False  True
  20 29.873195   0.071935 False False  True   True  True
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.
