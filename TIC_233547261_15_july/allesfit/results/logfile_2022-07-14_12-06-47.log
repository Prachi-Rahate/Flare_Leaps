Performing diagnostic tests on the fit's residuals...

Anderson-Darling Test
---------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals follows a normal distribution.
Test statistic		 12.119860235011004
Critical values		 [0.561 0.639 0.767 0.894 1.064]
Significance levels	 [0.15  0.1   0.05  0.025 0.01 ]
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
... 0.15 		 False
... 0.1 		 False
... 0.05 		 False
... 0.025 		 False
... 0.01 		 False
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
----------------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals show non-stationarity (trends).
Test Statistic           -3.869513
P-Value                   0.002271
# Lags Used               3.000000
# Observations Used     140.000000
Critical Value (1%)      -3.477945
Critical Value (5%)      -2.882416
Critical Value (10%)     -2.577902
Is the time series stationary? True
In simple words: your residuals look good.


Durbin-Watson Test
------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Test statistic: 0.28698367763151866
The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Interpretation:
	< 1.5 suggests a positive correlation
	1.5 to 2.5 suggests no correlation
	> 2.5 suggests a negative correlation
Signs of a positive correlation.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Ljung-Box Test
--------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
 lag    lb_stat    lb_pvalue  0.15   0.1  0.05  0.025  0.01
   1 107.639298 3.224282e-25 False False False  False False

  20 342.705289 1.415896e-60 False False False  False False
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.
