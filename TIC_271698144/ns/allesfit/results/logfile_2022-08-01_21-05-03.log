Performing diagnostic tests on the fit's residuals...

Anderson-Darling Test
---------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals follows a normal distribution.
Test statistic		 4.5987768096441215
Critical values		 [0.556 0.633 0.759 0.885 1.053]
Significance levels	 [0.15  0.1   0.05  0.025 0.01 ]
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
... 0.15 		 False
... 0.1 		 False
... 0.05 		 False
... 0.025 		 False
... 0.01 		 False
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
----------------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals show non-stationarity (trends).
Test Statistic          -2.711689
P-Value                  0.072037
# Lags Used              3.000000
# Observations Used     98.000000
Critical Value (1%)     -3.498910
Critical Value (5%)     -2.891516
Critical Value (10%)    -2.582760
Is the time series stationary? False
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Durbin-Watson Test
------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Test statistic: 1.703825905518843
The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Interpretation:
	< 1.5 suggests a positive correlation
	1.5 to 2.5 suggests no correlation
	> 2.5 suggests a negative correlation
No signs of a correlation.
In simple words: your residuals look good.


Ljung-Box Test
--------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
