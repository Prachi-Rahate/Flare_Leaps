Performing diagnostic tests on the fit's residuals...

Anderson-Darling Test
---------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals follows a normal distribution.
Test statistic		 1.70442373136774
Critical values		 [0.556 0.633 0.759 0.885 1.053]
Significance levels	 [0.15  0.1   0.05  0.025 0.01 ]
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
... 0.15 		 False
... 0.1 		 False
... 0.05 		 False
... 0.025 		 False
... 0.01 		 False
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
----------------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that the residuals show non-stationarity (trends).
Test Statistic         -6.464418e+00
P-Value                 1.416890e-08
# Lags Used             0.000000e+00
# Observations Used     1.010000e+02
Critical Value (1%)    -3.496818e+00
Critical Value (5%)    -2.890611e+00
Critical Value (10%)   -2.582277e+00
Is the time series stationary? True
In simple words: your residuals look good.


Durbin-Watson Test
------------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Test statistic: 1.188259581733136
The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Interpretation:
	< 1.5 suggests a positive correlation
	1.5 to 2.5 suggests no correlation
	> 2.5 suggests a negative correlation
Signs of a positive correlation.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.


Ljung-Box Test
--------------
This tests the null hypothesis that there is no correlation among the residuals.
Does the null hypotheses hold at a significance level of...
 lag   lb_stat  lb_pvalue  0.15   0.1  0.05  0.025  0.01

  20 49.735220   0.000242 False False False  False False
The null hypothesis is rejected at some significance levels.
In simple words: there might still be some structure in your residuals.
